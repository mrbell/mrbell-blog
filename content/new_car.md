After more than a year and a half of 90+ minute commutes, I've gotten tired of public transit and
decided to get a daily driver. I figure, why not get a fun one? I've always loved BMWs, and have
wanted an M3 forever. This seemed as good a time as any. So I got one. An E36 M3 to be exact.
Here she is.

I stalked craigslist for a few months, on and off. I was mostly looking for E36 or E46 M3s, but
considered 328s and 330s of the same eras for a while as well. My neighbor, who owns a '99 M3,
ultimately convinced me to stick with the M3 and broaden my search to have a better chance to find
what I really want.

Ultimately I found a promising looking car a couple of hours away. The ad touted no rust, runs well,
and the pictures showed that the interior is very clean. Black on black, vader seats. Nice.
180K miles, but what do you want for a 19 year old car. I called. It is stock. Good.
No stupid body mods, obnoxious exhaust systems, etc. If it's going to be modded, I want to do the
modifying. He has a long history of service records. There are some issues, of course.
The check engine light is on (of course it is), the sun roof is
messed up, the radio doesn't work, but mostly it runs great.

I convinced the owner to take it in for a PPI, at my expense of course, but he'd have to bring it in.
The report mostly just confirmed what the owner had told me, but uncovered a few other issues, too.
Worn drive belts, some leaks, possible issue with the cat or mass airflow sensor. The clutch, which I
had been told was original, was on its last legs (180K miles, no shit).

No deal breakers so far, so I made an offer and it was accepted. A week later I drove down with a
friend to do the deal and pick the car up.

We get there, and the owner has the car running to get the AC going (it was a hot day), and ready to
go. I actually was hoping to get to start it up cold to listen for any rattles (bad VANOS) or other noises.
I don't think the guy was trying to pull one over on me. I should have specified. It looked great, as
advertised, so I signed the papers, handed over a check, and was off! What a great car to drive! Quick.
Incredible handling. So fuckin' cool looking. I was actually not too sad that the stereo was out because
I was happy to listen to the engine all the way home.

The next couple of days were going to be long, waiting to drive it again until I could get to the RMV
to get it registered. I spent the time researching DIY fixes for issues and ordering some easily replaceable
parts.

Over the next week, commuting to work with the new ride, I started uncovering more issues. Some more minor
nagging issues. Others maybe more serious. This doesn't turn into a horror story or anything (not yet).
But the reality is that driving a car that is old enough to vote, you're going to find plenty to worry about
and even more to nit pick. I'll get into some of that in future posts, and detail some of the more significant
projects that I'm taking on (first up, VANOS replacement).
